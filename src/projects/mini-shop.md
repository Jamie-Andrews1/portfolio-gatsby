### React with Express backend

I built this project from scratch using what i have learned up to now, and included some authentication using json web tokens. Added mongoDb in for the storage.
I have gone between both storing the images in base64 encoding to the MongoDb database, and having them stored locally and the link uploaded to database. Code for both is available.

There is full CRUD operations and authentication.

I started off with making a express backend for a ecommerce type site which would work with views I wrote in plain javascript then deployed to heroku.

After learning some React and not being happy with the wind up time of heroku. I decided my next challenge could be to make the site full stack with a React front end. Using Hooks and Redux for state managment.

Deployed to digital ocean droplet using Caddy server.
