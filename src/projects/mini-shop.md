### Node project using express with mongoDb and vanilla js template for the UI

I built this project from scratch and included some authentication using json web tokens. Added mongoDb in for the storage.
I first stored the images in base64 encoding to the database, then decided to have them stored locally and the link uploaded to database, as I was concerned with space. But then changed back when deployed. code for both is available.
There is full crud operations and authentication.
Would like to make this or something simidlar with a react front end in the future.
